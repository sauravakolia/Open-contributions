## Module 2 Objectives

The module 2 of the OpenCV course mainly focuses image enhancing or image processing techniques.This module not only explain theortical concepts of the image processing but also provide the way of implementing those techniques using OpenCV functions. This module allow one's to experiment with the concepts.The module starts with explaning the segmentation techniques to finding contours in an image and it further uses these image processing techniques such as segmentaion and edge detetion in the process of face detection and at the end of the module it provide the brief introduction about depolyment of the machine learning model on local web server using flask framework.

## Object Detection

Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video.This technique is a intermixing of of object localiztion and classification. Object detection is one of the most sought-after Deep Learning application.The introduction of the Object detection revolutionized the twenty first century. It's application ranges from advanced weapons in militry to simple attendance system at university.

Object detection model can be implemented using algorithms such as R-CNN,Haar Cascading and YOLO(You Only Look Once) 

  * **R-CNN**</br>
    It may have been one of the first large and successful application of convolutional neural networks to the problem of object localization, detection, and segmentation.
    Their proposed R-CNN model is comprised of three modules; they are:

    * Module 1: Region Proposal. Generate and extract category independent region proposals, e.g. candidate bounding boxes.
    * Module 2: Feature Extractor. Extract feature from each candidate region, e.g. using a deep convolutional neural network.
    * Module 3: Classifier. Classify features as one of the known class, e.g. linear SVM classifier model.

  * **Haar Classifier**</br>
    * Haar Classifier which is proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones  in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a     machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
    * Haar Classifier algorithm is widely by used OpenCV for Object Detection.

  * **YOLO**</br>
    * The YOLO model was first described by Joseph Redmon, et al. in the 2015 paper titled “You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection.”
    * Due to it's fastness and robustness Yolo is one of the widely used objet detection algorithm used in real world application.
    * In this algorithm the neural network see the image once that is it passes the image through the network only one time.
    * Yolo algorithm divide the image into 1grid cells and apply the algorithm on each cell for detecting the required object.


## Module 2 Learning and Outcomes

This module covers almost every aspect of the image processing from segmentation to grid detection,edge detection ,gray scalling,counter finding etc.
The main aim of this module was to introduce the student to the basic computer vision techniques. This module was structured very nicely it starts from the basics of image processing and further used these techniques to implement the widely used applications of computer vision such as face detection and it also introduces flask framework for the web depolyment of the machine learning model as web depolyment allow one's to learn the use of algorithms in real world and it is also one of the most neccessary skills in IT industry. So, overall this module was a complete blend of theortical and practical concepts.
